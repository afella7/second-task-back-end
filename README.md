Task 2- Git and Version Control

# Version Control
Version control is the practice and process of tracking and managing changes to files or software code over time. It can help teams work together more efficiently and reduce the risk of losing work.

## Difference between git and github
Git is a tool for version control that enables you to monitor and record the evolution of your source code. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. Git is a piece of software. GitHub is an online SaaS service.

### 3 github alternatives
1. GitLab
2. Bitbucket
3. SourceForge

#### Difference between git fetch and git pull
git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. 

##### git rebase and the command for it
 A Git rebase changes the base of the developer's branch from one commit to another, so it looks like they have created their branch from a different commit. The command is `git rebase`

 ###### git cherry-pick and the command for it
 git cherry-pick is a command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. The command is `git cherry-pick`
